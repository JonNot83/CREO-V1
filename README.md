Creo_v1
=======

This is a simple webpage designed to provide Creo automation through PTC's integrated Pro/Weblink API. 
The site is hosted using github pages at: http://dfeagans.github.io/Creo_v1/ (GH-Pages Branch is Behind Currently)

I've worked through several of the non-trivial cases (atleast non-trivial to me haha). This included:
1. Listing all the *.drw's in your current workspace.
2. Exporting a pdf with custom settings (the settings were no-pdf_viewer and mono-color).
   This let me to realize that Pro-E must actually open/view the drw to save it as a pdf.
3. I've begun adding the logic structure to parse the filenames into their target directories.
   This will result in files of specific types being automatically placed in their appropriate folder.

Feel free to use any of this, but I would hugely appreciated if you'd teach me anymore you figure out.
