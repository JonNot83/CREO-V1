Creo_v1
=======

This is a simple webpage designed to provide Creo automation through PTC's integrated Pro/Weblink functions. 

-Current Status-
It currently connects to Pro-E successfully and I'm able to use several functions. I'm working towards automatically
exporting PDFs, but am having issues listing all the currently opened files. I believe it to be an issue with the item method.
