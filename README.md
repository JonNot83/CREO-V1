Creo_v1
=======

This is a simple webpage designed to provide Creo automation through PTC's integrated Pro/Weblink API. 
The site is hosted using github pages at: http://dfeagans.github.io/Creo_v1/

-Current Status-
The site connects to Pro-E successfully and I'm able to use several functions. The link that automatically opens the drw of the currently opened prt works.
I'm working towards automatically exporting PDFs, but am having issues listing all the currently opened files. I believe it to be an issue with the item method.

Feel free to use any of this, but I would hugely appreciated if you'd teach me anymore you figure out.
